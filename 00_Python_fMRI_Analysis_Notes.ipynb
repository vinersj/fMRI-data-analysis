    "1. In task-based fMRI, if participants move during task-relevant moments, you get a huge __false task-related signal taht's actually due to motion__!\n",
    "2. In resting-state fMRI, movment can induce false correlations between brain regions\n",
    "    - Resting-state fMRI is when the patient is lying down doing nothing.  Not doing a task.\n",
    "3. FMRIPREP can sort out some error due to motion just by aligning the images, but motion can lead to false spikes that FMRIPREP cannot sort out just by aligning\n",
    "--> Solution: modelling our fMRI signal to be comprised ot true brain signal and confounder signals (the motion signal), can regress out the confounder signal (e.g. compound regression) </br>\n",
    "--> The best place to reduce motion is in the scan itself, NOT post-processing.  For example: </br>\n",
    "1. Give patient a pillow\n",
    "2. Time in between tasks\n",
    "3. Ensure they don't feel claustrophoic in the chamber\n"
